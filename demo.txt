This is demo file for testing
Software testing is the process in which a developer ensures that the actual output of the software matches with the desired output by providing some test inputs to the software. Software testing is an important step because if performed properly, it can help the developer to find bugs in the software in very less amount of time. Software testing can be divided into two classes, Manual testing and Automated testing. Automated testing is the execution of your tests using a script instead of a human. In this article, we’ll discuss some of the methods of automated software testing with Python. Let’s write a simple application over which we will perform all the tests.
